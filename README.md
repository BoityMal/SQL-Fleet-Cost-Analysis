### Fleet Maitenance Metrics

                        |      Metric               |        Description                    |        Values             | 
                        -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                        | Number of vehicles        | Count of maintenance per Vihivle      | 15/week                   |
                        | Average cost per vehicle  | Avg cost of maintaining rach vehicle  | R36,000                   |

## Cost  vs Savings
Costs: R171K |██████████████████ 
Savings: R80k|███████████████ 

## Cost Savings Breakdowns
-**Total Costs**: R171K (Fuel: R135k + Maintenance: R36K)
-**Savingd**: R80K (from optimisation) 
-**Net cost**:R91K
 
## Optimisation Strategies
1. **Route optimisation**: Cut fuel costs (R135k) by 10-15% using GPS routing.
2. **Fuel management**: Reduce waste via eco-driving + tracking → save ~R7-13k extra.
3. **Preventive maintenance**: Lower breakdowns → cut R36k/vehicle cost by 10%.
4. **Vehicle utilisation**: Boost 85% uptime → reduce idle time.
5. **Contract renegotiation**: Re-bid services → cut maintenance costs 5-10%.
6. **Telematics**: Track drivers → spot inefficiencies → save ~R5-10k.
7. **Lifecycle management**: Replace old vehicles if ROI justifies it.

### Potential Extra Savings
- ~R30-50k (on top of R80k saved).

### Next Steps
- Pick a pilot strategy (e.g., route optimisation).
- Set KPIs (e.g., fuel-cost drop, uptime boost).
- Review after 4 weeks.
